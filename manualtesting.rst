Now that you have created a project and selected a build to test, you may want to get right into it and perform some manual testing on your app.

To start a Manual test session:

1. Click on the 'Manual' icon on the Project Dashboard
   
   A device selection screen now pops up. You may search for a device on the 'Device selection screen' based on device name, platform version, screen size, hardware configuration (e.g. Memory and CPU),  node name, node IP, etc.
 
2. Select the device you wish to test on by clicking on the 'Select' button under the device

   *Note:* RobusTest provides you a way to select multiple devices in parallel to perform your manual testing. To know more go to the page on :ref:`multi-device-testing` 
  
3. Once you have selected the device, click on the 'Play' button on the top right corner.
 
   The device screen now comes up and you can see that your app is installed on the device. 


Congratualtions! You have succesfully begun a Manual test session

  The device screen is where you perform your testing. You can perform various gestures like tap, swipe, scroll and entering text with the help of mouse/trackpad and keyboard. The buttons at the bottom of the screen are available for use as Android navigation buttons.
 
**2. Test Configuration section**

  The 'Test Configuration' section enables you to test better and easier by providing various add-on features

  Thse features are available across 2 menus:
